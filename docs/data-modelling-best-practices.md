# Best practices for data modelling

If you're focused on learning software engineering best practices (regardless of MVP constraints), here's the best approach for data modeling in your chat application:

Best Practice Approach: Separation of Concerns

## Use IDs for references, not full objects

```python
@dataclass
class Message:
    id: str
    sender_id: str  # Just the ID, not the whole User
    content: str
    conversation_id: str  # Just the ID, not the whole Conversation
    type: MessageType = MessageType.TEXT
    status: MessageDeliveryStatus = MessageDeliveryStatus.PENDING
    timestamp: float
```

This approach follows these important principles:

- Single Source of Truth: User and conversation data exist in one place only
- Memory Efficiency: Don't duplicate large objects
- Consistency: When user data changes, you only update it in one place
- Clear Dependencies: Explicit about what references what
- Database Readiness: Matches how relational databases structure data (foreign keys)

## Create service methods to resolve relationships
Your message service should handle the relationship lookups when needed:

```python
def get_message_with_related_data(message_id):
    message = messages_store.get(message_id)
    sender = user_service.get_user_by_id(message.sender_id)
    conversation = conversation_service.get_conversation_by_id(message.conversation_id)
    
    # Now you can work with all related data
    return message, sender, conversation
```

## Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API responses
When sending data to clients, you can assemble complete objects:

```python
def get_message_response(message_id):
    message = messages_store.get(message_id)
    sender = user_service.get_user_by_id(message.sender_id)
    conversation = conversation_service.get_conversation_by_id(message.conversation_id)
    
    return MessageResponse(
        id=message.id,
        sender=UserResponse.from_user(sender),
        content=message.content,
        type=message.type,
        status=message.status,
        conversation=ConversationResponse.from_conversation(conversation),
        timestamp=message.timestamp
    )
```

## Why This Is Better for Learning

- Teaches Proper Data Modeling: Matches how production systems and databases work
- Scalability Lessons: You'll understand how to build systems that can grow
- Performance Awareness: Helps you think about memory usage and data access patterns
- Clean Architecture: Enforces service boundaries and responsibility separation
- Future-Proof Skills: These patterns work in any programming language and framework

This approach requires a bit more code initially but teaches better software engineering practices that will serve you well in larger systems. It's exactly how I'd structure a production system, regardless of whether it's an MVP or not.

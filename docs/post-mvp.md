# Post MVP 

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (Current Monolith)
**Rationale:** Optimize your existing monolith before introducing architectural changes.

### Step 1.1: Caching with Redis
- Set up Redis for caching frequent queries (user profiles, conversation lists)  
- Create a caching layer in your service classes  
- Implement cache invalidation strategies  

### Step 1.2: Observability Setup
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs  
- Implement health check endpoints  
- Set up basic metrics collection  
- Create simple dashboards for monitoring  

### Step 1.3: Database Optimization
- Add database connection pooling  
- Implement read replicas pattern (simulated with comments if needed)  
- Add indexes to frequently queried fields  
- Optimize query patterns

## Phase 2: API Gateway & Rate Limiting
**Rationale:** Establish a separation layer that will facilitate the later transition to microservices.

### Step 2.1: API Gateway Implementation
- Set up an API gateway (Kong, Nginx, or custom solution)  
- Implement routing to your backend monolith  
- Add request/response transformation capabilities  

### Step 2.2: Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting at the gateway level  
- Add token bucket or sliding window algorithms  
- Configure different limits for different endpoints/users  

### Step 2.3: Authentication Enhancement
- Move authentication validation to the gateway layer  
- Implement JWT validation and generation  
- Set up role-based access control

## Phase 3: Message Queue and Asynchronous Processing
**Rationale:** Introduce event-driven architecture while still in the monolithic context.

### Step 3.1: Message Broker Setup
- Set up a message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka)  
- Create basic producer and consumer patterns  
- Design message schemas and topics  

### Step 3.2: Asynchronous Processing
- Move non-critical operations to background tasks  
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations  
- Add dead letter queues for unprocessable messages  

### Step 3.3: Event-Driven Architecture
- Create event publishers for key actions (message sent, user registered)  
- Implement event subscribers for various features  
- Establish patterns for event schema evolution

## Phase 4: Service Decomposition
**Rationale:** Begin breaking down the monolith with the groundwork of API gateway and messaging in place.

### Step 4.1: Authentication Service
- Extract user authentication into a separate microservice  
- Implement service-to-service communication  
- Use token-based authentication between services  

### Step 4.2: User Profile Service
- Extract user profiles and management into a dedicated service  
- Implement database per service pattern  
- Handle data synchronization challenges  

### Step 4.3: Conversation & Messaging Services
- Split conversation and messaging functionality into separate services  
- Move WebSocket handling to a dedicated service  
- Use the message queue for service communication  

---

## Phase 5: Resilience and Advanced Observability
**Rationale:** With multiple services, focus on making the system robust and transparent.

### Step 5.1: Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Implement circuit breakers for service calls  
- Add fallback mechanisms for service failures  
- Design graceful degradation strategies  

### Step 5.2: Distributed Tracing
- Set up end-to-end request tracing with tools like Jaeger/Zipkin  
- Add trace IDs to all requests  
- Visualize request flows across services  

### Step 5.3: Advanced Monitoring and Alerting
- Enhance metrics collection with Prometheus  
- Create comprehensive Grafana dashboards  
- Implement alerting for critical issues and SLA violations  

---

## Phase 6: Scaling and Performance Optimization
**Rationale:** With a microservice architecture established, focus on handling scale efficiently.

### Step 6.1: Horizontal Scaling
- Ensure all services are stateless for horizontal scaling  
- Implement session externalization where needed  
- Configure auto-scaling for services based on metrics  

### Step 6.2: Database Sharding and Partitioning
- Implement database sharding for conversations/messages  
- Design partition keys for effective data distribution  
- Handle cross-partition queries efficiently  

### Step 6.3: Advanced Caching Strategies
- Implement distributed caching patterns  
- Add cache-aside and write-through strategies  
- Optimize for specific access patterns and hot data  

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Features and Specialization
**Rationale:** Build on your robust architecture with specialized capabilities.

### Step 7.1: Search Service
- Implement Elasticsearch for message searching  
- Create indexing pipelines for message content  
- Design advanced search capabilities  

### Step 7.2: Analytics Service
- Set up real-time analytics processing  
- Implement stream processing for user activity  
- Create data warehousing for long-term analytics  

### Step 7.3: Media Service & CDN
- Create a dedicated service for handling file uploads  
- Implement media processing workflows  
- Add CDN integration for content delivery optimization

## Implementation Tips for Each Phase
- **Incremental Progress:** Complete each step fully before moving to the next  
- **Documentation:** Create architecture diagrams and update them as you progress  
- **Testing Strategy:** Develop automated tests for each new component  
- **Local Development:** Use Docker Compose to simulate your multi-service architecture

This plan provides a logical progression that builds each layer on top of previous foundations, with message queue and asynchronous processing as their own dedicated phase. The sequence moves from foundational improvements to increasingly complex distributed system patterns.

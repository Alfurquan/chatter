# Database Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement database persistence for the Chatter application, migrating from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Database Models
- Created SQLAlchemy ORM models in `app/db/models/`
  - `user.py`: User model with authentication fields
  - `conversation.py`: Conversation model with many-to-many relationship to users
  - `message.py`: Message model with relationships to sender and conversation

### 2. Repository Layer
- Added repository classes in `app/repositories/`
  - `user_repository.py`: CRUD operations for users
  - `conversation_repository.py`: CRUD operations for conversations
  - `message_repository.py`: CRUD operations for messages

### 3. Service Layer Updates
- Updated existing service classes to use repositories:
  - `user_service.py`: Now uses UserRepository
  - `conversation_service.py`: Now uses ConversationRepository
  - `message_service.py`: Now uses MessageRepository

### 4. Database Initialization
- Added `app/db/init_db.py` with functions to:
  - Create database tables
  - Initialize with default data if needed

### 5. Docker Configuration
- Updated Docker Compose to include PostgreSQL service
- Added environment variables for database connection

## Implementation Details

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Connection management via session factory pattern
- Environment variable configuration

### Data Modeling
- Used UUID primary keys for all models
- Implemented proper relationships:
  - One-to-many: User to Conversations (creator)
  - Many-to-many: Users to Conversations (members)
  - One-to-many: User to Messages (sender)
  - One-to-many: Conversation to Messages

### Repository Pattern
- Each repository takes a database session
- CRUD operations encapsulated in repositories
- Query optimization for common operations

### Dependency Injection
- Used FastAPI's dependency injection for database sessions
- Services take repositories as dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Add database migrations for schema changes
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Add unit and integration tests for database operations
4. Consider read/write splitting for scaling

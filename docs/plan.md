# Planning Your Real-Time Chat System Project

## 1. Clarify Requirements (Day 1)

Let's define what your chat application should do:

- Users can send messages to each other in real-time  
- Messages should be delivered immediately via **WebSockets**  
- Basic user authentication (simple at first)  
- Store message history for later retrieval  
- Display online/offline status (**presence indicator**)  

---

## 2. Design Core Components (Day 1-2)

Following the article's framework:

- **Client**: Web browser frontend (HTML/CSS/JS with WebSockets)  
- **Server**: Python FastAPI backend  
- **Database**: Start with SQLite for development, later move to PostgreSQL  
- **WebSocket Handler**: For real-time communication  
- **Docker**: Containerize the application  
- **Message Queue (Kafka, later phase)**: To handle message delivery between services and scale horizontally  

---

## 3. Design Data Models (Day 2)

- **User model**: `id`, `username`, `password_hash`  
- **Message model**: `id`, `sender_id`, `recipient_id`, `content`, `timestamp`  
- **Connection model**: `user_id`, `connection_status`, `last_seen`  

---

## 4. Implementation Plan - Iterative Approach

### Phase 1: MVP (Week 1)

- Setup FastAPI project with Docker  
- Implement basic WebSocket functionality (server-to-client messaging)  
- Create simple in-memory message storage  
- Build minimal UI for sending/receiving messages  

### Phase 2: Add Persistence (Week 2)

- Add database integration for user accounts and message history  
- Implement basic authentication  
- Store and retrieve messages from the database  

### Phase 3: Scaling Features (Week 3)

As the article suggests, we'll iterate with complexity:  

- Add a second server instance (test with Docker Compose)  
- Implement Redis for pub/sub between server instances  
- Add presence indicators (online/offline status)  
- Implement message caching for performance  

### Phase 3.5: Message Queue Integration (Optional / Advanced)

Use **Kafka** for decoupled message delivery:  

- Producers: WebSocket servers publish chat messages to Kafka  
- Consumers: Worker services consume from Kafka to:  
  - Persist messages into PostgreSQL  
  - Forward real-time events to WebSocket channels  
- Benefit: Reliable, scalable message pipeline with replay support  

### Phase 4: Simulate Failures (Week 4)

- Test connection recovery scenarios  
- Implement graceful error handling  
- Add basic monitoring  
- Test Kafka failover and consumer group rebalancing

## 5. Document & Review Process

Throughout each phase, document:

- Design decisions and their justifications  
- Challenges encountered and how you solved them  
- Performance observations  
- Tradeoffs you considered  

## Bonus

Enhance Current Project Instead: Consider whether you can incorporate some Top K elements into your existing chat app (like "trending chats" or "most active users"), giving you the best of both worlds.
